**TASK 16: Conclusion**

As a summary of the tools in this section:

- Proxychains and FoxyProxy are used to access a proxy created with one of the other tools
- SSH can be used to create both port forwards, and proxies
- plink.exe is an SSH client for Windows, allowing you to create reverse SSH connections on Windows
- Socat is a good option for redirecting connections, and can be used to create port forwards in a variety of different ways
- Chisel can do the exact same thing as with SSH portforwarding/tunneling, but doesn't require SSH access on the box
- sshuttle is a nicer way to create a proxy when we have SSH access on a target
